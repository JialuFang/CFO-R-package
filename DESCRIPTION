Description: In the context of phase I clinical trials, the primary objective is to ascertain the 
             maximum tolerated dose (MTD) corresponding to a specified target toxicity rate. The 'CFO' package 
             facilitates the implementation of dose-finding trials through the utilization of CFO-type designs. 
             Specifically, it encompasses the calibration-free odds (CFO) design (Jin and Yin (2022) <doi:10.1177/09622802221079353>), 
             the two-dimensional CFO (2dCFO) design (Wang et al. (2023) <doi: 10.3389/fonc.2023.1294258>), 
             Time-to-Event CFO (TITE-CFO) (Jin and Yin (2023) <doi:10.1002/pst.2304>), fractional CFO (fCFO), 
             accumulative CFO (aCFO), TITE-aCFO, and f-aCFO designs. The functionalities embedded in the 'CFO' 
             package include the determination of the dose level for the next cohort, the selection of the MTD 
             for a real trial, and the execution of single or multiple simulations to obtain operating 
             characteristics. The distinct feature of \pkg{CFO} is its flexibility in accommodating diverse 
             CFO-type designs, allowing users to tailor the approach based on factors such as dose information 
             inclusion, handling of late-onset toxicity, and the nature of the target drug (single-drug or drug-combination). 
             Moreover, as a precautionary measure, these functions are equipped with early stopping and dose 
             elimination rules to address safety considerations.
