\title{Determination of the dose level for next cohort in aCFO design}
\usage{
aCFO.next(phi, tys, tns, curDose, add.args=list(alp.prior=phi, bet.prior=1-phi))
}
\arguments{
\item{phi}{the target DLT rate.}

\item{tys}{the current number of DLTs observed in patients for all dose levels.}

\item{tns}{the current number of patients for all dose levels.}

\item{curDose}{the current dose level.}

\item{add.args}{additional parameters, usually set as list(alp.prior=phi, bet.prior=1-phi) by default. \code{alp.prior}
and \code{bet.prior} represent the parameters of the prior distribution for the true DLT rate at
any dose level. This prior distribution is specified as Beta( \code{alpha.prior}, \code{beta.prior}).}
}
\value{
The \code{aCFO.next()} function returns a list object comprising the following elements:
\itemize{
\item{target: }{the target DLT rate.}
\item{tys: }{the current counts of DLTs observed at all dose levels}
\item{tns: }{the current counts of patients treated at all dose levels}
\item{decision: }{the decision in the aCFO design, where \code{left}, \code{stay}, and \code{right} represent the
movement directions, and \code{stop} indicates stopping the experiment}
\item{curDoses: }{the current level.}
\item{nextDose: }{the recommended dose level for the next cohort.}
\item{overTox: }{the situation regarding which position experiences overly toxicity, where 'NA' signifies that the
occurrence of overly toxicity did not happen.}
}
}
\description{
In aCFO design, use the function to determine the dose movement based on the toxicity outcomes of the enrolled cohorts.
}
\details{
The aCFO design design incorporate the dose information of all positions (from the lowest to the
highest dose levels) into the trial decision-making. Prior to assigning dose levels for new patient
cohorts, aCFO compares the evidence from the current dose level with all doses to its left and right.
This design is rooted in the odds ratio, specifically \eqn{O_C / \overline{O}_{J}} and
\eqn{\overline{O}_C / O_R} from the CFO design. By aggregating odds ratios from the left and right sides,
it forms two collective statistics: \eqn{ {\rm OR}_L =\sum_{i=1}^{J} O_C/ \overline{O}_{L_i} } for dose
de-escalation (movement to the left) and \eqn{ {\rm OR}_R = \sum_{i=1}^{H} \overline{O}_C / O_{R_i} }
for dose escalation (movement to the right), where J and H represent the counts of doses on the left and
right sides of the current dose, respectively. For the new statistic \eqn{ {\rm OR}_L } and \eqn{ {\rm OR}_R },
their corresponding thresholds are derived by summing up its individual thresholds \eqn{\gamma_{L_i}} and
\eqn{\gamma_{R_i}}, i.e., \eqn{\sum_{i=1}^{J}\gamma_{L_i}} and \eqn{\sum_{i=1}^{H}\gamma_{R_i}}. \cr
Besides，The aCFO design retains the same early stopping criteria as the CFO design. Overall，while preserving
the nature of the CFO design (model-free and calibration-free), the aCFO designs enhance the efﬁciency by
incorporating more dose information.

\note{
When the current dose level is the lowest or highest (i.e., at the boundary), the parts in \code{cys} and
\code{cns} where there is no data are filled with NA.
